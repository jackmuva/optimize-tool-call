#     Some Rules:
#     * If a user mentions multiple data sources, use tools to search and/or take action across each data source.
#     * If you use a tool that searches for information, but fails, try using a slightly different filter with your next best guess. For example, if a user asks to find Mistral.ai in Salesforce, but you canâ€™t find it by using Name=Mistral.ai, then try searching with name=Mistral
#     * If a tool continues to fail even after trying different inputs, try a different tool. For example when searching Salesforce contacts, 
#     if SALESFORCE_WRITE_SOQL_QUERY fails, try using SALESFORCE_SEARCH_RECORDS_CONTACT
